## Using the App

### Searching for Museums

2. **Use the search bar** - Type a museum name, city, or state
3. **Apply filters** - Click "Filters" to see advanced options:
   - Filter by state or country

   - Sort by Location (grouped by state)

### Museum Cards

Each museum card shows:
- **Name and location**
- **Distance from your home** (if settings configured)
- **Admission badge** - Green = Free, Blue = 50% off
- **Proof Required badge** - Orange if proof of residence needed
- **Admission policy** - How many guests allowed
- **Special notes** - Any restrictions or exclusions
- **Action buttons**:
  - 📞 Phone - Tap to call
  - 🧭 Directions - Opens Google Maps
  - 🔗 Website - Opens museum website

### Understanding the 90-Mile Rule

**ASTC Rule**: You cannot use reciprocal admission at museums:
1. Within 90 miles of your home museum
2. Within 90 miles of your home address

The app automatically hides these museums when you configure your settings.

## Tips

- **Before visiting**: Call the museum to confirm admission policies
- **Bring your membership card**: Required for reciprocal admission
- **Check for proof of residence**: Some museums require ID or utility bill
- **Special exhibits**: Often excluded from reciprocal admission
- **Planetariums & IMAX**: Usually require separate tickets

## Troubleshooting

**Museums aren't showing up?**
- Check your filters - try resetting them
- Make sure you're on the correct tab (ASTC vs AZA)

**Distance not showing?**
- Configure your home museum in Settings
- Make sure you entered your zip code

**Can't find my home museum?**
- It might be in the other tab (ASTC vs AZA)
- Check the spelling

**How do I reset everything?**
- Open Settings and click "Clear"
